# Marcos Peter's React Onboard's Project

### There's my first React project inside Taqtile

## Project's Description

After my first backend onboard at taqtile, I'm moving on to the frontend onboard to follow in a company web project

## Environment and tools

VScode / Node.js (V: 16.14.2) / React (V: 18.2.0)

First of all, run:

## Steps to run and debug

Now it's time to install the dependencies:

After that, just run the project:
